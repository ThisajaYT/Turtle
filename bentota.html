    <p class="hover-animation">Bentota Turtle Hatchery is a sanctuary and conservation center dedicated to the preservation of sea turtles. Located in the beautiful coastal town of Bentota, Sri Lanka, our hatchery focuses on protecting and safeguarding sea turtles and their habitats. We rescue vulnerable sea turtle eggs from nesting beaches, providing them with a safe environment to hatch and develop. Our experienced staff and dedicated volunteers closely monitor the eggs, ensuring optimal conditions for their successful incubation. Once the hatchlings emerge, we nurture them until they are strong enough to be released into the ocean, where they can contribute to the survival of their species. Additionally, we actively promote awareness and education about the importance of sea turtle conservation, working with visitors, local communities, and schools to foster a sense of environmental stewardship. At Bentota Turtle Hatchery, we are committed to preserving these ancient creatures and ensuring their long-term survival in our oceans.</p>
