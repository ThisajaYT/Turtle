        The Kosgoda Turtle Hatchery is a conservation project located in the southern coastal area of Sri Lanka, about 13 kilometers south of Bentota. The hatchery was established in 1981 to protect sea turtles and their eggs from poaching and other threats, and to increase the turtle population along the Sri Lankan coast.
        <br>
        <br>
        At the Kosgoda Turtle Hatchery, staff members collect turtle eggs from nests along the beach and bring them to the hatchery, where they are protected until they hatch. Once the baby turtles hatch, they are kept in tanks until they are strong enough to be released into the ocean. The hatchery also serves as a sanctuary for injured and disabled sea turtles, providing medical treatment and rehabilitation before releasing them back into the ocean.
        <br>
        <br>
        Visitors to the Kosgoda Turtle Hatchery can learn about the different species of sea turtles that live along the Sri Lankan coast, as well as the threats they face and the conservation efforts being made to protect them. They can also observe the baby turtles and injured adult turtles being cared for at the hatchery.
        <br>
        <br>
        Overall, the Kosgoda Turtle Hatchery is a great place to learn about the importance of sea turtle conservation and to see firsthand the efforts being made to protect these amazing creatures.</p>

      <h2>Our Mission and Objective</h2>
      <div class="grid">
        <div class="turtle">
         
          <p class="hover-animation"> The mission of the Kosgoda Turtle Hatchery is to protect sea turtles and increase their population along the Sri Lankan coast. The hatchery's primary objective is to conserve sea turtle species that are threatened with extinction and provide a safe environment for sea turtle nesting. 
<br>
<br>
            The hatchery achieves this objective by collecting sea turtle eggs that have been laid on the beaches, and then incubating them in protected hatcheries until they are ready to hatch. Once the baby turtles have hatched, they are kept in tanks until they are strong enough to be released back into the ocean.
            <br>
            <br>
            In addition to protecting sea turtle eggs and hatchlings, the hatchery also provides medical treatment and rehabilitation to injured or sick adult turtles. The staff at the hatchery works hard to nurse these turtles back to health so that they can be released back into their natural habitat.
            <br>
            <br>
            Overall, the Kosgoda Turtle Hatchery's mission and objective is to ensure the survival and sustainability of Sri Lanka's sea turtle populations, and to raise awareness about the importance of protecting these amazing creatures.</p> </div>
